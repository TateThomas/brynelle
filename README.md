Source code for website for Brynelle Photo.

Brynelle Photo is a Utah photographer who specializes is wedding photography. To help her grow her brand and to give myself some experience with HTML, CSS, and JS, 
I offered to code a website for her from scratch. I'm sure lots of the code in the website can be done better with some other frameworks, but I decided to stick to 
the basics because I didn't wanna take the time to learn other frameworks, since I would rather spend more time learning other things. In return, it is probably 
causing me to spend more hours on this project than if I would just use some frameworks, but oh well.
